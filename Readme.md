# Overview

## Installing dependencies

I recommend setting up a new virtual environment first as described [here](https://github.com/IGILtd/IGI.ML.Server?tab=readme-ov-file#virtual-environment)

Once the virtual environment is set up and activated, install the dependencies:

```
python -m pip install -r ./requirements-dev.txt
```

## How to run

e.g.
```
python app.py
```

## The app
